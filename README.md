# Polymorphic Competitive Programming Code Generation
## INHERITANCE'24

### Overview

Works-On-My-Machine is an innovative AI-powered project aimed at generating polymorphic solutions for competitive programming (CP) problems. By fine-tuning and training models to think critically and implement processes like Chain of Thought (CoT), this project produces code that not only solves problems but does so in diverse ways, optimizing for time and space. The primary focus is to make this a powerful educational tool, enabling users to learn advanced programming techniques and problem-solving strategies, while maintaining fairness in competitions by discouraging misuse.

### Features

- Polymorphic Code Generation: Generates multiple valid and efficient solutions to a given CP problem, showcasing different problem-solving strategies.

- Chain of Thought Reasoning: Implements step-by-step logical reasoning processes to improve the accuracy and efficiency of generated solutions.

- Time and Space Optimization: Prioritizes optimized code outputs to help users understand trade-offs and improve their coding skills.

- Educational Orientation: Focused on teaching users how to think critically and approach CP problems creatively, not just providing answers.
