## Overview
This project introduces a robust, multi-agent system designed to analyze and solve competitive programming (CP) problems while generating comprehensive and edge-case test cases. With a curated database of over **450+ competitive programming problems**, the framework captures detailed problem descriptions, constraints, examples, and solution strategies across various complexity levels, including brute force, intermediate, and optimal approaches.

By constructing a dynamic knowledge graph and utilizing Graph-RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), the system retrieves and synthesizes problem insights to develop efficient solution pipelines. Through agent collaboration, it automates the problem-solving process from analysis to code generation.
